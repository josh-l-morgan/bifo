\# bifo



\*\*bifo\*\* is a collection of biological image processing modules tangentially related to bifoveate retinas.



\*trainTools\* Includes miscellaneous tools for training Unets to analyze 3D volumes

\*fetchChunkFromMips\* creates the class fetchDiced that reads a diced volume directory if images (diced/section\_number/mip\_level) and delivers 3D image chunks







\## Installation



```bash

pip install .

```



\## Usage



```python

import bifo.trainTools as tt
from bifo.fetchChunckFromMips import fetchDiced

```
